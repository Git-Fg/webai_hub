# AI Hybrid Hub

**An intelligent, hybrid AI assistant that bridges a native Flutter interface with the power of web-based AI providers through JavaScript automation.**

This project aims to transform a simple WebView manager into a sophisticated AI hub, implementing the complete "Assist & Validate" workflow. It combines a native chat UI with automated interactions, providing a seamless and powerful user experience.

---

### 📊 **Project Status: 🏗️ MVP In Progress**

-   **✅ Architecture Defined**: The foundational structure of the project is in place.
-   **🎯 Current Focus**: Implementing the end-to-end automation workflow for a **single provider**: Google AI Studio.
-   **🚀 Next Steps**: Finalize the JavaScript bridge logic, state management, and the core "Assist & Validate" orchestration.

### ✨ Key Features (Vision)

-   **Native Chat Interface**: A modern, bubble-style UI for sending prompts and viewing aggregated conversations.
-   **Multi-Provider Integration**: Seamlessly switch between and interact with providers like Google AI Studio, Qwen, Z-ai, and Kimi.
-   **"Assist & Validate" Workflow**: A 4-phase automation process (Sending, Observing, Refining, Extraction) that combines automated assistance with full user control.
-   **JavaScript Automation Bridge**: A robust, bi-directional communication layer to pilot web interfaces from the native application.
-   **Session Persistence**: Maintain login states across all providers for a frictionless experience.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

-   **Framework**: Flutter 3.19+ / Dart 3.3+
-   **State Management**: Riverpod (with `riverpod_generator`)
-   **WebView Integration**: `flutter_inappwebview`
-   **Automation Bridge**: TypeScript + Vite

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### **Prerequisites**

-   Flutter SDK (>= 3.19.0)
-   Node.js and npm
