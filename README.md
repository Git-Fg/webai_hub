**An intelligent, hybrid AI assistant that bridges a native Flutter interface with the power of web-based AI providers through JavaScript automation.**

Inspired by the powerful workflow of [Code Web Chat](https://github.com/robertpiosik/CodeWebChat).

AI Hybrid Hub transforms your mobile device into a sophisticated control center for web-based AI tools. It combines a native chat UI with a powerful JavaScript automation bridge, allowing you to interact with AI providers like Google AI Studio directly from a single, unified interface.

### ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Native Chat Experience** — A modern, intuitive chat UI for sending prompts and viewing conversations with features like message editing and copying.
- ✅ **Multi-Provider Integration** — Connects seamlessly to multiple providers like Google AI Studio, with a modular architecture ready for ChatGPT, Claude, and more.
- ✅ **Contextual "Assist & Validate" Workflow** — A unique process where you build a "meta-conversation" in the native UI. The entire chat history is used as context for the AI, enabling complex, multi-turn dialogues, while you visually validate each step in a fresh, clean WebView session.
- ✅ **JavaScript Automation Engine** — A powerful TypeScript-based engine pilots web interfaces, handling logins, prompt submissions, and response extractions.
- ❤️ **Free and Open-Source** — Released under the GNU license.

### 📊 Project Status & Roadmap

This project is under active development.

#### ✅ Currently Functional

- Core "Assist & Validate" workflow.
- Integration with **Google AI Studio**.
- Native chat interface with message history, editing, and copying.
- Robust, modular TypeScript architecture for the automation engine.

#### 🚀 On the Roadmap

- Adding more AI providers (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
- Advanced chat features: conversation export (Markdown), multi-message selection.
- File attachments (TXT, PDF) for context augmentation.
- UI for managing provider-specific settings (model selection, temperature, etc.).

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter & Dart
- **State Management**: Riverpod (`riverpod_generator`)
- **WebView Integration**: `flutter_inappwebview`
- **Automation Bridge**: TypeScript + Vite

### 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites**

- Flutter SDK (>= 3.3.0)
- Node.js and npm

**Installation & Launch**

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
    cd ai_hybrid_hub
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    npm install
    ```

3. **Build the JavaScript bridge:**
    *This command is mandatory after any change in the `ts_src/` directory.*

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4. **Generate Dart code:**
    *Run this after modifying Riverpod providers or Freezed models.*

    ```bash
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```

5. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
