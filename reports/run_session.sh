# run_session.sh (v1.0 - Unified):
# - Manages a single Flutter run session for autonomous validation.
# - Self-cleaning: If a PID file exists from a previous run, it terminates
#   that process before starting a new one.
# - Starts a new Flutter app instance in the background.
# - Logs all output to a unique, session-specific file.
# - Stores the new process PID.
# - Outputs the SESSION_ID for use by the calling script.
#
# Usage:
#   bash reports/run_session.sh        # Start a new session
#   bash reports/run_session.sh stop   # Stop the current session only
#
