## Code Generation — build_runner

- After any changes to files containing `@riverpod` or `@freezed` annotations, you MUST run this command to regenerate the necessary code:
  - `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

## Why

- The project relies on generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`) for state management (Riverpod) and data models (Freezed).
- Stale generated code will cause compilation errors, runtime failures, and broken tests.

## Guidance

- **Do NOT edit generated files manually.** Your changes will be overwritten.
- If the analyzer complains about missing parts or unresolved symbols in generated files, it means you need to re-run the `build_runner` command.
