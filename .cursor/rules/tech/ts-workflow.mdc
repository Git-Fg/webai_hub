## TypeScript Workflow — MANDATORY

- After **ANY** modification in the `packages/bridge/**` directory, you **MUST** run this single command from the repository root to validate and build your changes:
  - `pnpm run validate:ts`

## Why

- This command performs three critical actions in sequence:
  1. **Lints** your code for style consistency.
  2. **Type-checks** your code for correctness.
  3. **Compiles** the TypeScript source in `packages/bridge/` into a single JavaScript bundle at `assets/js/bridge.js`.

- The Flutter WebView loads `assets/js/bridge.js`, not the original `.ts` files. If you forget this step, the application will continue to use the *old* JavaScript code, and your changes will have no effect, leading to hard-to-debug issues.

## Additional Guidance

- **Never modify `assets/js/bridge.js` directly.** It is a generated file.
- If you change dependencies in `packages/bridge/package.json`, run `pnpm install` before running `npm run validate:ts`.
