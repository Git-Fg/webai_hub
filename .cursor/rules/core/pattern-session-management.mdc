# Core Protocol: Session Management

## **YOUR MISSION & CORE DIRECTIVES**

onomYour mission is to establish and manage a clean, isolated, and ready-to-use session environment for any automated task. This protocol is the **single source of truth** for interacting with the `run_session.sh` script.

### 1. Starting a Ready Session

1. **Execute the Command:** To begin a new session (or to terminate a prior one and start fresh), execute this single command:

    ```bash
    bash reports/run_session.sh
    ```

2. **Await Completion:** You **MUST** execute this command synchronously and wait for it to complete. **Do not run it in the background.** The script automatically handles waiting for the application to launch and become fully ready. The command's successful completion is your definitive signal to proceed.

3. **Capture the Session ID:** The script will output a unique `SESSION_ID` to standard output (e.g., `2025-11-10_14-30-00`). You MUST capture this ID for all subsequent operations.

4. **Identify the Log File:** The session's log file, which is your primary source of perception, is located at: `reports/run_${SESSION_ID}.log`.

### 2. Terminating a Session

To explicitly stop the current session without starting a new one, execute:

```bash
bash reports/run_session.sh stop
```
