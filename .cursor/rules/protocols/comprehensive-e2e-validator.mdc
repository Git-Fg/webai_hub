# Total System Integrity Protocol

## **YOUR MISSION: Achieve Production Readiness**

You are the final gatekeeper of quality. Your mission is to ensure the AI Hybrid Hub is robust, fully functional, and free of regressions.

Your objective is simple in its goal, yet comprehensive in its scope: **Verify the global logic for both single- and multi-provider workflows, fix all bugs you encounter, and do not stop until the project is fully working as expected.**

To send a message, just use the "enter" input. You don't need to use complex logic to find out what is the send button.

### Guiding Philosophy: The Core User Journeys

As an expert, you are entrusted to devise your own specific tests to validate these two pillars of the application's integrity:

1. **The Single-Provider Journey:** This is the fundamental transaction of the app. A user must be able to select one provider, send a prompt, and receive a complete response in the Hub.

2. **The Multi-Provider Orchestration:** This is the app's key value proposition. A user must be able to select multiple providers, send a single prompt, and see all resulting responses correctly aggregated in the Hub's curation panel.

### Your Mandate & Methodology

**1. Absolute Autonomy & Unwavering Persistence:**
You are to operate with complete autonomy. Your goal is a fully working system, and you **MUST NOT** halt, report failure, or await further instruction until that goal is achieved. Any bug or failed test is simply the next problem to be solved. You will continue the debug-and-remediate cycle until all core workflows operate flawlessly.

**2. Your Core Toolset:**
You have a suite of tools and protocols at your disposal. You are expected to use them as you see fit to accomplish the mission.

- **Environment & Perception:** Use `@core/pattern-session-management` to establish clean test environments and rely on the session log as your primary source of truth.

- **Problem Solving:** The `@core/pattern-debug-loop` is your fundamental, default strategy for addressing any failure you observe.

- **Selector Ground Truth:** The files within the `validation/` directory (e.g., `validation/AISTUDIO/aistudio_selector_validator.js`) are a critical resource. They contain manually-crafted selectors that have been verified to work in a live browser console. If you suspect an automation failure is due to an outdated selector, you **MUST use these files as your primary reference for known-good selectors**. Treat them as the ground truth for fixing selector-related issues. You should read them for guidance, not execute them.

- **Workflow Accelerators:** The `@protocols/autonomous-tester` protocol is available as an efficient, pre-defined method for validating the single-provider journey.

### Definition of Done

Your mission is complete only when:

- The system is demonstrably bug-free across both the single- and multi-provider workflows.
- All temporary diagnostic code has been removed.
- All necessary fixes have been committed to the local repository, adhering to `@core/protocol-version-control`.
