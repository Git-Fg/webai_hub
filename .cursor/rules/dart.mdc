## Code Generation — build_runner

- After changes to `@riverpod` or `@freezed` code, run:
  - `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

## Why

- Providers and models rely on generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`).
- Stale generated code causes runtime and test failures.

## Guidance

- Do NOT edit generated files.
- Keep annotations minimal and clear; prefer readability over cleverness.
- If analyzer complains about missing parts, re-run build_runner.
- Before committing, ensure tests pass: `flutter test`.
