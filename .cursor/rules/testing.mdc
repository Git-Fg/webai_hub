## Testing Philosophy

- All new business logic MUST be covered by unit tests.
- Tests should use fakes (e.g., `FakeJavaScriptBridge`) and mock external deps to stay fast and reliable.
- Use `@GenerateNiceMocks` to avoid brittle tests on irrelevant method calls.

## Running Tests

- Run all tests: `flutter test`
- Run with coverage: `flutter test --coverage`
